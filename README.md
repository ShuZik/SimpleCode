# Simple Code

Project includes a set of random screens and animations. This code is designed purely to showcase skills:

- Implementation of custom animations.
- Use of **SwiftUI** framework.
- Declarative UI design and state management.
- A minimalist approach that emphasizes code clarity and structure.

---

## Technologies

- Language: **Swift**
- Camera framework: **AVFoundation**
- Architecture: **Flux**
- Minimum iOS version: iOS 17.
- Minimum watchOS version: WatchOS 10.


# Proof of Concept
## Camera PoC

Camera PoC showcasing the ability to take photos on an iPhone using an Apple Watch as a remote control. 
It is implemented with the **Flux** architecture to demonstrate expertise with this architectural pattern.

---

## Project Goals

- Showcase the integration between iPhone camera and Apple Watch.
- Demonstrate remote photo capturing using Apple Watch.
- Highlight experience with the **Flux** architecture.

---

## Flux Architecture

The project is built using the **Flux** architecture, which includes:

- **Views:** UI components that react to state changes and render data.
- **Actions:** Definitions of changes that can be applied to the state.
- **Dispatcher:** Handlers that process actions and update the state.
- **Store:** A centralized state management system.
- **State:** Keep all things.

## Features

- Remote control of the iPhone camera via Apple Watch.
- Capturing photos using the watch.
- Clean implementation based on the **Flux** architecture.

---

## Usage Example

1. Open the app on your iPhone.
2. Launch the companion app on your Apple Watch.
3. Use the watch interface to control photo capturing.
4. Captured photos are displayed on the iPhone.
